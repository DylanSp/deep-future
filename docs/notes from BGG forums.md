# Notes from BoardGameGeek forums

- [Good review](https://boardgamegeek.com/thread/2533098/solo-impressions-after-3-vanilla-and-7-dizzy-varia)
  - It mentions that a lot of the game's difficulty is frontloaded; it's very hard early on, but gets easier as the game progresses. [This thread](https://boardgamegeek.com/thread/2965548/repeatedly-losing-to-challenges-immediately-am-i-d) has the designer acknowledging this.
- [Thoughts after playing the game for a long campaign](https://boardgamegeek.com/thread/1888857/deep-future-after-14-eras)
- [Rules for Dizzy's variant](https://boardgamegeek.com/filepage/131897/dizzys-variant-rules-for-deep-future) (fairly commonly used - adds complexity, more lategame difficulty)
- [Step-by-step playthrough - good for showing how the game works](https://boardgamegeek.com/thread/2478100/step-by-step-through-a-session-of-deep-future)
- [Suggested house rule](https://boardgamegeek.com/thread/2538038/article/36243963#36243963) - whenever a planet is created, add a dot to its sector on the map.
